- #### [Quark](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark)

  Quark is a fully modular mod with the objective of improving the vanilla gameplay experience. In other words, I would call it "what I would add if I was hired at mojang — the mod". Modules can be turned off and all features can be turned off individually. Some even have more in-depth configs.
