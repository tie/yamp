- #### [ImmersiveRailroading](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-railroading)

  Immersive Railroading adds a new transport system (item and players) to the game. It is based on real world physics (where possible) and uses life size models to convey the true scale and grandeur of Railroading.

  Note: Villagers pay with 1 emerald per 1000km (1 block is 1 meter). Nice!
  Note: Immersive Engineering and Open Computers are recommended for full functionality.
