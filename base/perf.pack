  LagGoggles is a profiler where you can see timings in the world, visually. It’s an attempt to create an understanding of what causes lag on a server to regular players.

  Note: FAT version ships Mixin, which is a library that LagGoggles needs in order to function. It’s possible that another mod already ships Mixin or has another version. If you have SpongeForge or another mod that requires a different version of Mixin, choose the THIN release.
