  Tinkers’ Construct is a mod about putting tools together in a wide variety of ways, then modifying them until they turn into something else. The tools never disappear and can be named and changed to your heart’s desire. Once you make them, they’re yours forever. Many different materials can be used to make your tools.

  Remember the good old days when you played GTA, used the cheat code for a tank, and then went on and caused mayhem? This mod is like that, except for Tinkers’ Construct Tools and the cheatcode takes longer to enter.
