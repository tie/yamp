  Serene Seasons is a Minecraft mod that adds seasons.  Grass and foliage colors will change throughout the year, and in the winter, temperatures will shift and allow for snow to fall in some biomes that don't normally receive any.  Seasons also affect various other features, like crop growth (Different crops are limited to different seasons), weather (More rain in Spring, more storms in Summer, etc.), and more!
