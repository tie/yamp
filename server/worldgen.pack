  Realistic Terrain Generation (RTG) is a mod that adds a new world type which generates realistic terrain. It doesn't add new blocks. It doesn't add new mobs. It doesn't even add new biomes. It simply generates more realistic-looking terrain for existing Overworld biomes (including those added by other mods).

- #### [DoomlikeDungeons](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/project-74246)

  This mod will add dungeons meant to resemble levels from retro "2 1/2d" first-person shooters, and was inspired by earlier dungeons mods and by Oblige (especially version 3.57), a random level generator for Doom. The goal is to create interesting, tactically challenging, and highly varied multi-room dungeons that are fun to explore and rewarding to conquer.
