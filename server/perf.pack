- #### [Phosphor](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/phosphor)

  Phosphor is a Minecraft mod which works to optimize one of Minecraft's most inefficient areasâ€”the lighting engine. With Phosphor, the time spent generating chunks can be reduced by almost 80% for some dimensions, and server tick rate can be just as greatly improved by freeing up the CPU to work on other tasks.
