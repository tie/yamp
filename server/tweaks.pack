- #### [GottaGoFast](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gotta-go-fast)

  This mod removes the server side check for if a player moves too far too quickly which then teleports them back. Allows clients to send fast update packets. Beware.

  This allows people to travel faster with things like the IC2 Jetpack.

- #### [HelpFixer](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/helpfixer)

  HelpFixer changes the /help command to go around the offending code and sort the commands by a method that will work. HelpFixer also logs offending commands to the server log, allowing you to figure out who was causing the problem.

  Some modded commands incorrectly implement a certain piece of code. This piece of code is used for sorting the list of commands alphabetically in the /help command. This incorrect code actually causes the /help command to break with an error that is vague and confusing.
