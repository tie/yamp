- #### [GottaGoFast](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gotta-go-fast)

  This mod removes the server side check for if a player moves too far too quickly which then teleports them back. Allows clients to send fast update packets. Beware.

  This allows people to travel faster with things like the IC2 Jetpack.
